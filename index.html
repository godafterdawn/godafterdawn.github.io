<p style="font-family:courier; font-size:30px;">Grand Theft Auto 5 was launched in the year 2013. And since then it has been one of the greatest PC games ever to be in the market. Even today when so many new games have been introduced, the hype for the game continues.

<div style="background:rgba(125,125,0,0.5)"><p style="font-family:courier; font-size:30px;"> This game not only has an amazing story mode with an addictive storyline but also multiple online playing modes. This allows the player not to stick to just one story. Moreover unlike the other Grand Theft Auto games, this game allows players to switch between characters and play there separates storylines. My favourite part is the hiests which include all the playable characters working at the same time and allowing you to complete a mission with simultaneously switching characters.
